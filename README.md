# BayesianMNLRegression
An implementation of Bayesian Multinomial Logit Regression following the work of Holmes and Held (2006). This is a work in progress :) You can expect more updates and descriptions in the near future. 

Check out their paper here:

Leonhard Held. Chris C. Holmes. "Bayesian auxiliary variable models for binary 
    and multinomial regression." Bayesian Anal. 1 (1) 145 - 168, March 2006.

NOTE: The pseudocode in their paper contains a slight error. This is currently being rectified in our MNL regression class.
